# Introduction

## System Philosophy

Karhuno Analysis System was designed with a fundamental understanding: in modern business, opportunities are often visible through digital footprints before they become obvious. The system bridges the gap between vast amounts of unstructured data and actionable business intelligence.

### Why Signal Intelligence?
Traditional lead generation often relies on static data or broad targeting. Signal Intelligence takes a different approach:
- Instead of "who might need our product?", we ask "who is showing signs of needing it right now?"
- Rather than mass outreach, we enable precise timing
- Focus on actual business events rather than assumed needs

For example:
- A company announcing office relocation is more likely to need office design services
- A business implementing solar panels signals interest in energy efficiency solutions
- New hiring patterns can indicate expansion or technological transformation

## System Purpose

Karhuno automates the process of discovering and analyzing these business signals from open data sources. This automation is critical because:

- **Scale**: Manual monitoring of multiple sources is impossible
  - A typical search covers 50+ queries across multiple sources
  - Each query can return hundreds of results
  - Processing this volume manually would take days

- **Speed**: Opportunities have limited time windows
  - Manual processing might take 2-3 days
  - Automated processing reduces this to 2-3 hours
  - [See Performance Metrics](../performance/metrics.md)

- **Consistency**: Human analysis varies
  - Automated analysis ensures consistent criteria
  - Reduces missed opportunities
  - Enables objective comparison

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection
- **XMLSTOCK Integration**: Aggregates search results from multiple engines
  - Why XMLSTOCK? [See Architecture Decisions](architecture.md#xmlstock-choice)
  - How it scales: [Performance Details](../performance/scaling.md)

### 2. Analysis Pipeline
- **LLM Processing**: Intelligent signal analysis
  - Current setup: GPT-4o-mini as primary model
  - Fallback options: [LLM Configuration](../prompts/llm.md)
  - Processing strategies: [Analysis Pipeline](data-pipeline.md)

### 3. Task Management
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks management
  - Why Celery? [Architecture Decisions](architecture.md#task-queue)
